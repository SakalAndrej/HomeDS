\chapter{Additional Information} \label{cha:additional-information}
If needed the appendix is the place where additional information concerning your thesis goes. Examples could be:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Source Code
	\item Test Protocols
	\item Project Proposal
	\item Project Plan
	\item Individual Goals
	\item \ldots
\end{itemize}
Again this has to be aligned with the supervisor.
