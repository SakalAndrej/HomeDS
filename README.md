# HomeDS - Home DigitalSignage [![Build Status](http://vm59.htl-leonding.ac.at:9090/job/HomeDsSystems_Backend/badge/icon)](http://vm59.htl-leonding.ac.at:9090/job/HomeDsSystems_Backend)

This is a Project made as a Diploma Thesis. This project manages the presentation devices of the HTL Leonding based in Upper Austria. You can designe your own layouts with various out of the box widgets. Like playing Project Prasentations videos, showing informative text, digital or analog clock and the wheather based on the GPS data of the display and so on. This system has all possibilities.

Through our Android App and Website the user can play media's simple, remote and super fast. Also there is a "Show News" function where the HTL Office can "post" news and they are shown on the Videowall in the entry of the school.

This is our personal and customizable Digital Signage System. Our Project should help to easily and with a minimal effort create really beautiful Desktop Diashows.
With that systems in combination displaying personal data like Wheater, Youtube Feeds, News Feed or whole Web Pages gets very easy and adaptive.
